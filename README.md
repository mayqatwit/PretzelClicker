# PretzelClicker
Spring 2023 final project for COMP 1050. Pretzel Clicker is a single-player idle-style game where you click on a large pretzel to collect pretzels, and you can spend those earned pretzels on buildings that can collect pretzels for you without the need to click. You can also save your progress, close the game, and come back at any time to continue where you left off.

This project was accomplished with several topics, such as Object-Oriented Programming, JavaFX, Interfaces, and File I/O.
